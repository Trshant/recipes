2.00 tbsp cooking oil ( any kind )  
  
## HowTo
Chat masala to taste.

Bake the chickpeas for 30mins at 30C. We want chickpeas that are cooked but with a hard-ish cover.

Heat oil. add mustard seeds. wait till it splutters.  
Add the green chilli, saute for a few seconds.  
  
At this point the oil should be smoking a bit.  
Drop the chickpeas in it. saute for a minute.

Sprinkle the cumin and coriander powders. Add some pepper too if you want extra spice.  
Sprinkle some salt for taste. I put in about 0.25 tsp.
