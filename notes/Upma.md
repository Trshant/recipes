empty roasted sooji into a dish

Put 2 spoonfuls of any odorless oil and 2 spoonfulls of ghee into the empty pan.
Put in a heaped spoonful of mustard seeds.
Put this on a high flame.

As soon as the mustard starts splutterring, put in the grated ginger. stir for 30 seconds.
Put in 2 tablespoons of Blackgram seeds(Udad) and Chana Daal. Take off the flame so as to avoid burning the items. 
Add 2 chopped chilllies. As soon the Blackgram seeds show browning, put in the curry leaves (2 leaves fresh or 3-4 leaves dried).

Once the curry leaves is fried, then we add a single chopped tomato and any other chopped vegetable(s). Put it back on the flame and  stir it, till the tomatoes are mushy.

Put in 2 cups of hot water and bring it to boil. In the meantime, taste the water. it should be a little more than a little salty and chilly hot.

Once the water is adequetly hot temperature-wise and taste-wise, mix the Sooji slowwly to the water, stirring it all continuously. move it to a low flame, cover with a top, and cook for 15-20 minutes.

Upma is ready.
