# Spaghetti With Meatballs

We used the meatballs from IKEA.

## Ingredients

### Marinara
meatballs: 8-10
tomato puree packets: 2
Oil: 30ml
Salt to taste
**chopped finely:**  
  basil leaves: 8 
  bay leaves: 3
  big garlic pods: 3
  Big onion: 1

### Spaghetti
**Each serving of spaghetti takes**:
100grams of spaghetti.
250ml of water.
7 grams of salt.

## Method

Heat oil in pan. lower flame to slightly above simmer setting
Put in onions, saute till they are white, almost brown. 
_Hint : Add some salt (0.5 tsp) after you add the onions so that it cooks faster_.
Add the garlic. saute for a minute.
Add Tomato puree of one packet. saute till the mix turns brown.
Add Puree of another packet. mix it all. Add salt (about 1.5 tsp).
Add the meatballs.
Cover dish and cook for 30 minutes.
Add basil and mix it all up. 


Heat up water with salt. After the water comes to a rolling boil, put in the spaghetti. Dont worry about the long size, as the spaghetti cooks, it will become soft enableing the uncooked portions to drop into the water to cook.
After the last of the spaghetti is in the water, cook the spaghetti for 9 minutes. This ensures that the spaghetti is _al dante_. Its just cooked enough that the teeth can go thru it, but not so soft that the water is logged in the spaghetti. 

Pull the half cooked spaghetti out of the water onto a plate, pour in the marinara sauce  on top.
